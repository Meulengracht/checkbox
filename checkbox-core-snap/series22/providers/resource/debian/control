Description: Checkbox resource jobs provider
 This package provides the resource jobs. It is used together
 alongside with Checkbox.
 .
 Jobs are smallest units of testing that can be performed by Checkbox.
 All jobs have an unique name. There are many types of jobs, some are fully
 automated others are fully manual.
 .
 Resources are collections of key-value data sets that are generated by
 special resource jobs. They are extensively used to indicate hardware or
 software dependencies. For example a bluetooth test may indicate it
 requires bluetooth hardware and appropriate software packages installed.
